# FirstAndroidApp
This is my first Android app. It was written for educational purposes
In the code you can find:
Converter - converts values between (W, Kw Hp ...)
Translator - translates English words into Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French
  -translator gets the word entered by the user, 
  -next the word is sent as a request to "http://newjustin.com/translateit.php,
  -then gets a response from the server.
Clicker - accumulates the number of button presses
Lamp - switching on / off camera light
